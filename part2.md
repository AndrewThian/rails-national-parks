# National Park - Part 2
Time to add some styling to our site, using the rails asset pipeline.

### Bootstrap
First things first, install and setup the [Bootstrap-SASS Gem](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#a-ruby-on-rails) and the [Bootstrap form helper](https://github.com/bootstrap-ruby/rails-bootstrap-forms).

Once you have that installed, style your pages using the standard bootstrap classes. You'll want to do stuff like:
* adding a navigation bar
+ use tables for lists
+ use nice forms
+ alert styling
+ buttons

### Bootstrap + SASS
Now that you have your page looking ok, it's time to customize it using SASS. Checkout the [list of available variables](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables) and start changing some to make your site more unique. Try to make it unrecognizable that it is built with Bootstrap.

### Bonus
Explore some of the option options available in SASS, such as mixins to add some additional styles to your site beyond what you've built with Bootstrap.
